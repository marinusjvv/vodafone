This project was created in order to complete a technical test
for Vodafone. You can clone it using the following commind: 

git clone git@github.com:marinusjvv/vodafone.git

You will then have to run the following command in the project's
main folder, in order to download it's dependancies:

composer install


I chose not to map out all the paths from startup of the program, as
some paths may later become invalid. An example of this is if a
device gets disconnected.
